# Mail
This is a course project from CS50 where I write a lot of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to do the front end from a mail application, *you can create an account, log in, see your fake emails, write emails and archive them.*

I did not write the backend of this application, the school give me this part. 

ItÂ´s very simple but functional.

You can see all the functions in this [video](https://youtu.be/00ZkB7zFL84).
